    <p>Every great idea starts with curiosity — and mine was no different. What began as simple interest soon grew into a passion for learning, creating, and improving every single day.
Through challenges, failures, and small victories, I’ve learned that growth never happens overnight — it’s built one step at a time.</p>
<p>This website is a reflection of that journey: a space where I share what I’ve learned, what I’m building, and what I dream to create next.</p>
